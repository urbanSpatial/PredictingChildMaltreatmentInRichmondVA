# PredictingChildMaltreatmentInRichmondVA

There are two goals of the work presented here. First, to create a comprehensive open source framework for developing a child maltreatment predictive model to estimate maltreatment risk across Richmond.

Second, to document a strategic planning process for converting maltreatment risk predictions into actionable intelligence stakeholders can use to efficiently allocate limited child welfare resources. In this ‘Align’ phase of the framework, we assess the extent to which the current supply of child welfare services is properly distributed relative to the demand for these services.

All the tools required for replicating our analysis can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/urbanSpatial/spatialML_package). While we will continue to develop this codebase into a more easy to use package for replicating the analysis, we hope curious civic technologists will adopt the code for their own purposes.
